The OpenROV suite of software is intended for hacking, extending, and modification by everyone.  This guide is intended to get you started on making those changes.  This is a work in progress, feel fee to update this guide and submit pull requests back through github!

The ROV images comes fully loaded with an integrated development envionment for making code changes baked in.  

Were going to get started with creating a new image from scratch.  

We are using a base image that is provided by beaglebone.org and modifying it with custom changes and software loads for OpenROV.  The detailed instructions can be found here: https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-image/blob/master/build-dev-image.md

So now you have an image with the latest version of both our customizations for the linux rootfs image as well as for the OpenROV software that comes with it.
